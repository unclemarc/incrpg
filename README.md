==============

Incremental Game with the goal of growing and growing as much as possible.

The original game can be played here: http://cdpn.io/AybpC

Was not pulling properly from original page or after forking, so I copied to https://github.com/unclemarc/incrpg

<h3>Goals from original project</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alter the style to better suit the theme.</li>
  <li>More types of accommodation.</li>
  <li>More buildings.</li>
  <li>More Upgrades</li>
  <li>Graphics and icons.</li>
</ul>

Many of those goals seem to be already in place, such as sound. As of Jan 14, my first goal is to figure out how to save the name of the town and mayor, since that was promised and looks to be fairly easy to do.
